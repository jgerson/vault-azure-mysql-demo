# azure-vault-mysql
This directory contains demonstration code for both Terraform and Vault on Microsoft Azure. The Terraform configuration serves two purposes: 

1. To show how easy it is to use Terraform on Azure and
2. To build the Vault database secrets engine demo.

To set up and run either or both demos, simply follow the instructions below.

### Setup instructions
1. Clone or download the code from here: https://github.com/vault-snippets
2. Open a terminal and cd into the vault-azure-mysql-demo directory
3. Copy the settings in `terraform.tfvars.example` into a `terraform.tfvars` file. Edit the variables to customize your demo.
4. Run `terraform plan` and then `terraform apply`
5. Go get some coffee. It takes roughly 8-10 minutes to provision this demo on Azure.
6. When the demo setup is done, follow the steps listed in the Terraform output.

### Demo Script
